This Project could be departed into two parts roughly:

1. Motion Capture to collect High Quality Animation Clips.
2. Real-time body tracking, motion comparision, avatar binding, etc.

## Build and Run

This project is dependping on some essential hardwares:

1. [Azure Kinect DK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/kinect-dk), which is a Depth Camera for body-tracking.
2. Any VR Headset could used for developing. In this project, I used the [VIVE Pro2](https://www.vive.com/uk/product/vive-pro2/overview/). But I strongly to use light-weight headsets.

This project was developed using the Unity engine and I used some add-ons. Some of them are paid and copyrighted that must be added to the project separately.

1. [Modern UI Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-201717)
2. [Ultimate Replay 2.0](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/ultimate-replay-2-0-178602)
